    "description": "<p class=\"text-indent-4\">HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the fundamental building block for webpages. It defines the structure and meaning of content, separate from presentation (CSS) and interactivity (JavaScript). HTML uses tags to mark up text, images, and other elements for browsers to interpret and display. These tags come in various types, like &lt;p&gt; for paragraphs, &lt;img&gt; for images, and many more. The key concept is that elements are enclosed by angled brackets \"&lt;\" and \"&gt;\".  While tags can be written in different cases, lowercase is the recommended standard.</p><br /><hr class=\"my-4\" /><br /><p class=\"text-indent-4\">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language that defines how HTML and XML elements are displayed. It's a foundational technology for the web, with consistent implementation across browsers based on W3C standards. While there used to be numbered CSS versions (CSS1, CSS2.1, etc.), development is now modular, with ongoing updates to individual modules (e.g., CSS Color Module Level 5). This avoids versioning the entire specification and allows for more targeted improvements.</p>",
